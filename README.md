# IBM DS8000 Safeguarded Copy

The focus of this solution is to highlight early threat detection by IBM® QRadar® and to proactively start a cyber resilience workflow in response to a cyberattack or malicious user actions.

The workflow uses IBM Copy Services Manager (CSM) as orchestration software to start IBM DS8000® Safeguarded Copy functions. The Safeguarded Copy creates an immutable copy of the data in an air-gapped form on the same DS8000 system for isolation and eventual quick recovery.
